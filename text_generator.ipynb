        "Explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Function Definition:**\n",
        "   - The function `generate` takes four arguments:\n",
        "     - `filename`: The filename of the text to use for training the model.\n",
        "     - `start_words`: A list of words to start the generated sentence with. This list should have the same length as `chain_length`.\n",
        "     - `chain_length`: The length of the Markov chain, which determines how many previous words are considered when predicting the next word.\n",
        "     - `num_generated`: The number of words to generate in the output sentence.\n",
        "   - The function returns a string containing the generated sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Input Validation:**\n",
        "   - The function checks if the length of `start_words` is equal to `chain_length`. This ensures that the starting phrase has the same length as the context window used for prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reading Text and Splitting into Words:**\n",
        "   - The text is read from the file and split into a list of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Building the Transition Dictionary:**\n",
        "   - An empty dictionary `transitions` is created to store word transitions.\n",
        "   - The function iterates through the list of words, considering a window of `chain_length` words at a time.\n",
        "   - For each window (key), a list of possible next words (values) is stored in the dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Generating the Sentence:**\n",
        "   - The `sentence` list is initialized with the `start_words`.\n",
        "   - A loop iterates for `num_generated` times to generate the desired number of words.\n",
        "   - Inside the loop:\n",
        "     - The function retrieves the transition probabilities for the last `chain_length` words in the sentence (using `transitions.get`).\n",
        "     - If no chain is found (meaning the specific sequence of words hasn't appeared in the training text), a random word is chosen from the entire vocabulary (words list).\n",
        "     - Otherwise, a word is chosen based on"
